# 📊 SQL-Based Analysis of Product Sales  

This project performs an in-depth **SQL-based analysis** on product sales data, supported by **Python** for visualization and insights.  
It demonstrates how structured queries and analytical methods can reveal business trends, top-performing products, and customer behavior.  

## 📌 Project Objectives  
- Query a sales database using **SQL**.  
- Analyze sales performance by product, region, and time.  
- Identify top revenue-generating items and categories.  
- Detect monthly and yearly sales trends.  
- Translate raw data into actionable business insights.  

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries  
- **SQLite** – database storage and querying  
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** – analysis & visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – exploration and reporting  

## 📊 Key Insights  
- **USA** is the leading revenue contributor, followed by **Canada** and **France**.  
- TV Series soundtracks and popular albums were among the **top-selling products**.  
- Sales show **seasonal spikes** in multiple years (2010–2013).
